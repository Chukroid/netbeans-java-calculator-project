# Command-line Calculator in Java
A command-line calculator project implemented in Java using NetBeans as a school project. Performs basic and scientific arithmetic operations through console inputs, emphasizing core Java programming principles.
This project was made in Apache Netbeans IDE 16. Also it is in Spanish language.

# What I learnt while working on this project
* How to obtain user inputs in the console and work with it. In this case, I used the Scanner class to scan the user's input
* When and where to use necessary Classes, Libraries or Packages to either facilitate the process and accelerate my coding. In this case, I used the Math class to do all the operations needed for each option.

# How to Install and Run
* Make sure you have Apache Netbeans IDE installed (Preferably 16 and up)
* Download the Zip file from this repository
* Extract the downloaded File into a folder of your choice
* Open the Apache Netbeans IDE
* Click on "File" on top left corner of the IDE
* Click "Open Project" and select the folder
* That is all, Run the file

This was a school project so you might still encounter some errors while using or testing it out. If you encounter any, feel free to make a Pull Request. Doing one will actually make me so happy. Thanks!!!
